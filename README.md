# Physiology

Everything related to the physiology of my big Proteomics cultures.

I have data for 2 strains of the open ocean ditaom  _Thalassiosira oceanica_: **TO 1005** and **TO 1003**.
I grew them under **4 different Fe and/or Cu** concentrations

* high Fe / high Cu
* low Cu
* low Fe
* low Fe Cu

and grew each one in **biological triplicate 10L cultures** and checked various physiological parameters

* growth rate
* cell size and volume
* Chl a content
* 14C uptake
* FeDFB uptake
* total protein
* AOX usage
* Respiration / Oxygen Evolution

Now I would like to determine how different these two strains react to low Fe and/or low Cu treatments. I will determine this

* within each strain and between strains i.e.
  + is the growth rate significantly decreased under low trace metal (TM) treatment?
  + how is this reflected in the other physiological parameters?
    + what does _Chl a_ content do as an adaptation to low TM?
    + how is FeDFB uptake affected by low TM?
      + is it differently affected depending on the TM?
      + does this differ between species?
